    # Hello, Observable Notebook Kit
  </script>
  <script id="2" type="text/markdown">
    I’ve been a strong believer in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebooks since shortly after the launch of the public beta in 2018. Observable’s reactive evaluation model conforms effortlessly to my mental model of how updates should flow, and I’ve always found the UX and product execution top notch. I have about 520 private notebooks on my account—most of them throwaway notebooks, of course—and about [sixty or so notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@rreusser/writeups) which are somewhat more presentable.

    So when I saw the [Observable Notebook Kit](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) had launched, apart from the surprise of satisfying the long-awaited desire for open notebook editor tooling, I didn't delay.
