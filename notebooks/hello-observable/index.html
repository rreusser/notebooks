    It’s no secret that since soon after the launch of the public beta in 2018, I’ve been a pretty strong believer in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebooks. Observable's reactive cell execution has made it quite difficult to me to use Jupyter notebooks. I have about 520 private notebooks on my account—most of them throwaway notebooks, of course—and about [sixty or so notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@rreusser/writeups) which are somewhat more presentable.
