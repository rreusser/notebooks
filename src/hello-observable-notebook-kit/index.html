    # Hello, Observable Notebook Kit!
  </script>
  <script id="21" type="text/markdown">
    [Observable Notebooks 2.0](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/) is here! And my first impression is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs good. üéâüçæ
  </script>
  <script id="2" type="text/markdown">
    Let‚Äôs back up. I‚Äôve been a strong believer in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebooks since the public beta launched in 2018. It‚Äôs the coding environment I always wanted but had not myself managed to will into existence. Reactive cell evaluation conforms easily to my mental model of how code should run, and Observable‚Äôs editor UI/UX and product execution has always been top-notch. [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) is wonderful. I have about 520 private notebooks, about about [sixty of which](https://observablehq.com/collection/@rreusser/writeups) are somewhat presentable.
  </script>
  <script id="15" type="text/markdown">
    Of course Observable isn't without imperfections. [Observable-flavored JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/documentation/cells/observable-javascript) isn‚Äôt for everyone. JavaScript libraries to power numerical analysis have always been underpowered. The vertically-tall notebook format doesn‚Äôt perfectly fit horizontally-wide screens. And ‚Äú[Please](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/dataflow-a-self-hosted-observable-notebook-editor/5055) [allow](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/offline-editor/4905) [us](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/noob-can-you-run-your-own-observable-server/757/1) [to](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/private-installations/501) [edit](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/notebooks-as-offline-first-single-webfiles/10145) [notebooks](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/where-is-observable-going/10372) [outside of Observable](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/source-control-observable/3117)‚Äù is the longest-running feature requests I can recall.
  </script>
  <script id="16" type="text/markdown">
    Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I‚Äôve always been uneasy about ceding control over my work to a private company. From everything I can see as an outsider, they‚Äôre wonderful people making wonderful products. Still, it‚Äôs a roll of the dice to trust that notebooks I create today will be there tomorrow, and even if the company folded up and left static notebooks online in perpetuity‚Äîmore than they actually owe us‚ÄîI‚Äôd still lose the ability to edit the notebooks I‚Äôve created.
  </script>
  <script id="17" type="text/markdown">
    When I saw the [Observable Desktop](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/desktop) and [Observable Notebook Kit](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) product announcements, it was quickly clear they‚Äôd done it right.
  </script>

    I mean, this is it, right? An offline editor application whose output is a human-readable HTML file. What else is there? Notebooks are now just a few lines of code. The interface works offline and if you install a lightweight dev server, you can sidestep the app in favor of a text editor and a web browser.

    There‚Äôs no sense talking this to death. You should [go try the app](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/desktop)!

    ## Notebook Kit
  </script>
  <script id="39" type="text/markdown">
    The second new component is [Notebook Kit](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/kit). There‚Äôs a bit more to understand here. There are different library components‚Äîvite, build, utility, and runtime‚Äîand I‚Äôve only scratched the surface.
  </script>
  <script id="25" type="text/markdown">
    As far as the coding experience goes, there are some subtle differences. In addition to [Observable JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/documentation/cells/observable-javascript), you can now code in *plain old* JavaScript. It took me a bit of experimentation to understand how this plays with reactive cell evaluation.
  </script>
  <script id="29" type="text/markdown">
    Recall that with Observable JavaScript, each cell has a single output. The runtime performs a topological sort of cell inputs and outputs and executes cells in whatever order is required. Cells look like either a bare value, e.g.
  </script>
  <script id="26" type="application/vnd.observable.javascript" pinned="">
    x = y + 5
  </script>
  <script id="27" type="text/markdown">
    or wrapped in a block with a return statement like this
  </script>
  <script id="28" type="application/vnd.observable.javascript" pinned="">
    y = { return z + 1; }
  </script>
  <script id="40" type="text/markdown">
    The new development is that plain old JavaScript now also plays well with Observable notebooks, though it now takes a `display()` helper to produce visual output.
  </script>
  <script id="32" type="module" pinned="">
    const z = r;
    display(z);
  </script>
  <script id="41" type="text/markdown" pinned="">
    Notice that `z` has already been used above when defining `x` in an Observable JavaScript cell! This only works in different cells; variables within a single cell are of course not reactive.
  </script>
  <script id="36" type="module" pinned="">
    const t = s + 2;
    const s = 1;
  </script>
  <script id="48" type="text/markdown">
    And as always, this is still Observable, so it‚Äôs all running live and has access to lovely libraries like [Observable Inputs](https://observablehq.com/documentation/inputs/overview).
  </script>
  <script id="47" type="application/vnd.observable.javascript" pinned="">
    viewof r = Inputs.range([1, 10], {step: 1, label: 'r'})
  </script>
  <script id="38" type="text/markdown">
    ## Integration
  </script>
  <script id="42" type="text/markdown">
    There are other major features like being able to pull directly from source on the disk and no longer having to live inside Observable's magic `<iframe>`.
  </script>
  <script id="46" type="text/markdown">
    The real moment of truth for me though was discovering what it means to integrate this into my personal website.
