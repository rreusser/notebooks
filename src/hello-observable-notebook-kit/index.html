    # Hello, Observable Notebook Kit

    [Observable Notebooks 2.0](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/) is here! And my first impression is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs good. üéâüçæ
  </script>
  <script id="2" type="text/markdown">
    Let‚Äôs back up. I‚Äôve been a strong believer in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebooks since the public beta launched in 2018. It‚Äôs what I always wanted but never myself been able to will into existence. The reactive cell evaluation conforms easily to my mental model of how code should run, and Observable‚Äôs editor UI/UX and product execution has always been top-notch. [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) is wonderful. I have about 520 private notebooks, about about [sixty of which](https://observablehq.com/collection/@rreusser/writeups) are somewhat presentable.

    Of course Observable isn't without imperfections. JavaScript libraries to power numerical analysis have always been underpowered. The vertically-tall notebook format doesn‚Äôt conform well to horizontally-wide screens, so I oddly structure my notebooks to be developed in two side-by-side windows, one for editing code and the other for viewing the output. And ‚Äú[Please](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/dataflow-a-self-hosted-observable-notebook-editor/5055) [allow](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/offline-editor/4905) [us](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/noob-can-you-run-your-own-observable-server/757/1) [to](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/private-installations/501) [edit](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/notebooks-as-offline-first-single-webfiles/10145) [notebooks](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/where-is-observable-going/10372) [outside of Observable](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/source-control-observable/3117)‚Äù is one of the longest-running feature requests I can recall.

    Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I‚Äôve always been uneasy about ceding control over my data to a private company. They‚Äôre good‚Äîthey‚Äôre really, really good‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a roll of the dice to trust that notebooks I create today will be there tomorrow.

  <script id="3" type="text/markdown">
    I‚Äôd already made a few aborted attempts to shoehorn downloaded Observable notebooks into my personal website template, but they‚Äôd be‚Äîat best‚Äîstatic snapshots of my editable notebooks, and at any rate, any approach I‚Äôd tried was tacky enough that I‚Äôd never actually carried through

    When I saw the [Observable Desktop](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/desktop) and [Observable Notebook Kit](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) product announcements, it was quickly clear they‚Äôd done it right.

    I mean, this is it, right? An offline editor whose output is a human-readable HTML file. What else is there? Notebooks are now just a few lines of code.

    Most notably, there‚Äôs a new editor interface.
