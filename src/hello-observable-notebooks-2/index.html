    # Hello, Observable Notebooks 2.0!
  </script>
  <script id="21" type="text/markdown">
    [Observable Notebooks 2.0](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/) is here! And my first impression is… it’s *good*.
  </script>
  <script id="67" type="text/markdown">
    More important than anything I have to say about it, the notebook you’re currently reading is my first attempt to publish a notebook to my website. I’m quite happy with the result. 🎉🍾🥳
  </script>
  <script id="2" type="text/markdown">
    Let’s back up. I’ve been a strong believer in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) notebooks since the public beta launched in 2018. It’s the coding environment I always wanted but had not myself managed to will into existence. Reactive cell evaluation conforms easily to my mental model of how code should run, and Observable’s editor UI/UX and product execution has always been top-notch. [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) is wonderful. I have about 520 private notebooks, about about [sixty of which](https://observablehq.com/collection/@rreusser/writeups) are somewhat presentable.
  </script>
  <script id="15" type="text/markdown">
    Of course Observable isn’t perfect. [Observable-flavored JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/documentation/cells/observable-javascript) isn’t for everyone. JavaScript libraries to power numerical analysis have always been underpowered. The vertically-tall notebook format doesn’t perfectly fit horizontally-wide screens. And “[Please](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/dataflow-a-self-hosted-observable-notebook-editor/5055) [allow](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/offline-editor/4905) [us](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/noob-can-you-run-your-own-observable-server/757/1) [to](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/private-installations/501) [edit](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/notebooks-as-offline-first-single-webfiles/10145) [notebooks](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/where-is-observable-going/10372) [outside of Observable](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/source-control-observable/3117)” has been a long-running feature request.
  </script>
  <script id="16" type="text/markdown">
    Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I’ve always been uneasy about ceding control of my work to a private company. From everything I can see as an outsider, they’re wonderful people making wonderful products. Still, sometimes I’d like to poke around at medical, legal, or propietary data, and even for casual notebooks, it’s a roll of the dice to fully trust that notebooks I create today will be here tomorrow.
  </script>
  <script id="17" type="text/markdown">
    They haven’t suddenly solved everything, but when I saw the [Observable Desktop](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/desktop) and [Observable Notebook Kit](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) product announcements, it was quickly clear they’d done something meaningful and done it well.
  </script>
  <script id="18" type="text/markdown">
    ## Observable Desktop
  </script>
  <script id="19" type="text/markdown">
    I mean, this is it, right? An offline editor application whose output is a human-readable HTML file. What else is there? Notebooks are now just a few lines of code. The interface works offline and if you install a lightweight dev server, you can sidestep the app in favor of a text editor and a web browser.

    There’s no sense talking this to death. You should [go try the app](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/desktop)!
  </script>
  <script id="11" type="text/markdown">
    ## Notebook Kit
  </script>
  <script id="39" type="text/markdown">
    The second new component is [Notebook Kit](https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/kit). There’s a bit more to understand here. There are different library components—vite, build, utility, and runtime—and I’ve only scratched the surface.
  </script>
  <script id="25" type="text/markdown">
    As far as the coding experience goes, there are some subtle differences. In addition to [Observable JavaScript](https://observablehq.com/documentation/cells/observable-javascript), you can now code in *plain old* JavaScript. It took me a bit of experimentation to understand how this plays with reactive cell evaluation.
  </script>
  <script id="29" type="text/markdown">
    Recall that with Observable JavaScript, each cell has a single output. What we may previously have written as a bare and block statements `x1` and `y1`, respectively,
  </script>
  <script id="26" type="application/vnd.observable.javascript" pinned="">
    x1 = y1 + 5
  </script>
  <script id="28" type="application/vnd.observable.javascript" pinned="">
    y1 = { return r; }
  </script>
  <script id="40" type="text/markdown">
    we now write as plain old JavaScript,
  </script>
  <script id="72" type="module" pinned="">
    const y2 = r;
    const x2 = y2 + y2;
    display(x1);
    display(y2);
  </script>
  <script id="41" type="text/markdown">
    From what I can tell, it still processes top-level variables of `.js` cells in cell-wise topologically-sorted execution order; it’s just that it now permits such variables as plain old JavaScript with multiple outputs.
  </script>
  <script id="48" type="text/markdown">
    And as always, this is still Observable, so it’s all running live and has access to lovely libraries like [Observable Inputs](https://observablehq.com/documentation/inputs/overview). You just need to swap out `viewof` with `view()`.
  </script>
  <script id="47" type="module" pinned="">
    const r = view(Inputs.range([1, 10], {step: 1, label: 'r'}))
  </script>
  <script id="74" type="text/markdown">
    ~~There do appear to be a few missing features, though of course that’s to be expected since it’s billed as a technology preview. For example, pulling in Observable notebook cells with `import` works great. But importing a `viewof` does not.~~

  </script>
  <script id="59" type="text/markdown">
    ***Update***: Mike Bostock has [provided some assistance](https://bsky.app/profile/ocks.org/post/3lvjhyimjuc2x) and gently nudged me toward JavaScript rather than Observable JavaScript as the path forward. I’ve updated the code below correspondingly.
  </script>
  <script id="75" type="text/markdown">
    We’ll test out imports by importing a figure from my notebook [Drawing 3D Objects with SVG](https://observablehq.com/@rreusser/drawing-3d-objects-with-svg). It seems that `"viewof$*"` in JavaScript is interchangeable with `"viewof *"` in Observable JavaScript, and with that, we’re back up and running.
  </script>
  <script id="61" type="module" pinned="">
    import { figure, viewof$rotation } from 'observable:@rreusser/drawing-3d-objects-with-svg'
  </script>
  <script id="63" type="module" pinned="">
    figure
  </script>
  <script id="62" type="module" pinned="">
    viewof$rotation
  </script>

    ## Integration
  </script>
  <script id="42" type="text/markdown">
    The real moment of truth for me though was discovering what it means to integrate this into my personal website.
  </script>
  <script id="49" type="text/markdown">
    Overall, the story is quite good. It uses the wonderful [Vite](https://vite.dev/) tooling to produce static output. Multiple pages are easy to set up. And you can provide a HTML template to wrap content. I accomplished most of this with some light vite configuration, [which you can find here](https://github.com/rreusser/notebooks/blob/main/vite.config.js).
  </script>
  <script id="71" type="text/markdown">
    I also ended up slightly modifying [@observablehq/notebook-kit](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit) so that I could pull notebook metadata into the surrounding template via a `transformTemplate` function I added. You can find my changes [here](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit/compare/main...rreusser:notebook-kit:transform-template?expand=1), which I’ve [submitted as a PR](https://github.com/observablehq/notebook-kit/pull/30), though I do suspect there are probably better ways to accomplish this.
  </script>
  <script id="52" type="text/markdown">
    ## Conclusion
  </script>
  <script id="53" type="text/markdown">
    I’ve always been a fan of Observable, but with this new tooling, it feels like we’ve sort of arrived. I always wanted sort of a combo blogging platform slash notebook development environment, and for the first time ever, it’s sort of just unfolded in front of me without any major obstacles.
