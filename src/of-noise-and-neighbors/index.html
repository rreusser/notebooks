    _Knock knock knock knock knock._

  <script id="4" type="text/markdown">
    It’s early September 2023. I absentmindedly open the door, and standing in the hallway is a man I don’t recognize.
  </script>
  <script id="5" type="text/markdown">
    “_What are you doing up here?_” He looks at me intently. “_I’m downstairs and you’ve been stomping on the floor all night._”
  </script>
  <script id="6" type="text/markdown">
    I realize the man lives directly below us. “I’m sorry,” I respond, though I’m not. “I had no idea I was making any noise. Can you describe what you’re hearing?”
  </script>
  <script id="7" type="text/markdown">
    “_You know what you’re doing up here. You’re stomping on the floor or having a party or something. If you don’t stop, I’ll call the police._”
  </script>
  <script id="8" type="text/markdown">
    I feel my face flush. I did retrieve a backpack from the closet a few minutes ago, but I haven’t even been home most of the night. I know he’s mistaken, but he strikes me as legitimately upset. We continue, but the more he insists I know what I’ve done, the more I pull back. The conversation stalls.
  </script>
  <script id="9" type="text/markdown">
    “I’m sorry, but I don’t know what you’re talking about,” my voice wavers as I move to retreat into our home. He stops the door with his hand. I push hard; he pushes harder. The struggle lasts only a few seconds. The door latches and I lunge for the deadbolt. The man leaves.
  </script>
  <script id="10" type="text/markdown">
    The next morning I leave home for two weeks. The encounter fades. Mistakes happen.
  </script>
  <script id="11" type="text/markdown">
    But two days after returning home, late at night, he corners me in the hallway as I return from walking our dog. We repeat the entire script. The first encounter felt like a misunderstanding, but this time his intransigence feels menacing.
  </script>
  <script id="12" type="text/markdown">
    I maneuver past him and overpower him a second time to retreat into our home.
  </script>
  <script id="13" type="text/markdown">
    “STOP IT AND GO HOME,” I boom, my hands trembling.

    _KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK._
  </script>
  <script id="15" type="text/markdown">
    As I emerge from sleep, the police identify themselves at our front door. It’s 12:40 AM, late September, four days after the second encounter. My wife and I squint as our eyes adjust to the overhead kitchen light. A disturbance has been reported coming from our unit, an officer informs us, though I detect hesitation as they size us up. We explain the recent encounters; they explain that whatever is going on, it’s a civil matter between us and our neighbor.
  </script>
  <script id="16" type="text/markdown">
    My wife falls back asleep, but I lie awake, rolling the matter over and over in my head. _How can we defend ourselves against nothing at all? Why do we need to? Is there no one with the authority to sort this out and put a stop to it?_
  </script>
  <script id="17" type="text/markdown">
    The next morning I visit property management. They’ve been receiving complaints about us all month. A few minutes in, the man from the hallway enters the office. He appears unassuming. If I’ve seen him prior to these encounters, I don't recognize him. Hopeful we can reset the situation, I extend my hand to properly introduce myself.
  </script>
  <script id="18" type="text/markdown">
    We speak for about thirty minutes. I speculate about alternate sources of the noise, but the man accepts no explanation that doesn’t involve malice on my part, even volunteering that he observes me and my wife from the rooftop balcony to figure out what exactly we do inside our home. My legs grow unsteady.
  </script>
  <script id="19" type="text/markdown">
    As the conversation spirals, a second property manager intervenes, suggesting we reconvene the next day for an impromptu noise investigation. I consent, hoping he can still be persuaded that no harm has been done to him.
  </script>
  <script id="20" type="text/markdown">
    The investigation demonstrates only that jumping as hard as possible on our bedroom floor fails to reproduce the noise he claims we generate constantly. As vindicating as I believe this to be, the investigation yields no formal outcome. But something in me shifts. I can no longer see any room for misunderstanding. My thoughts turn darker, though I’m unable to piece together any coherent explanation for his actions.

    _POUND… POUND… POUND…_
  </script>
  <script id="22" type="text/markdown">
    Shortly after the noise investigation, we notice an unusual pattern of noise. Three to five heavy pounds, intermittent, sometimes at 7 PM, sometimes at 3 AM. Noise in a shared living space is perfectly ordinary, but this feels heavy, angry. Once, dishes fall over in the kitchen. Sometimes I’m certain that the pounding is a direct response to our walking across the floor, but most of the time there is no discernible cause. I frequently wake up at night with a pounding in my head, my heart racing. Each time, I hold my breath, waiting for subsequent pounding to confirm I’ve not merely dreamt it.
  </script>
  <script id="23" type="text/markdown">
    I begin to dread walking across the floor, understanding that a single misplaced step is sufficient to provoke another night of sleepless retaliation. My wife reminds me that we’ll experience the disturbances regardless, but I’ve collected enough evidence to demonstrate otherwise. When she drops a box of pasta on the floor, I feel a flash of anger at the consequences of her carelessness before quickly, silently reining in my emotions. Visiting friends in their homes, I’m surprised to discover that a heavy footstep or slammed cabinet sends my heart racing. Left with nowhere to escape, I sometimes retire to bed at 7 PM. My work suffers.
  </script>
  <script id="24" type="text/markdown">
    I become angry—not at the man downstairs, but at myself, because I'm not strong enough to simply ignore it all, because the only way I can see to fight against the world he’s constructed is to engage with it, to be pulled further into it. I want to reach out and stop myself as I catch myself looking with suspicion around every corner and fixating on his presence. I wonder if this is how he experiences the world. _Folie à deux_?
  </script>
  <script id="25" type="text/markdown">
    Left with few options, we fill out paperwork for a restraining order. Eventually, continued pounding and another late-night visit from the police cement our determination.
  </script>
  <script id="26" type="text/markdown">
    The moment the temporary restraining order is served, the disturbances stop.
  </script>
  <script id="27" type="text/markdown">
    The court hearing at the end of November is neither pleasant nor quick. For two hours, the judge sifts through claim and counterclaim. She corners the man, pressing him, “So you confronted him as he returned from walking his dog? How could he have been making noise *inside* his apartment if he was *outside* it?"
  </script>
  <script id="49" type="text/markdown">
    When the judge finally announces her decision, the release is overwhelming. I accept inclusion of our animals in the protective order and stand my ground in yielding no contact information to the man. We exit the courtroom without looking at him. And yet, even with everything laid bare, we still understand nothing about why he has pursued us for three relentless months.

    _Knock knock knock knock._
  </script>
  <script id="29" type="text/markdown">
    My heart pounds, I feel lightheaded, but three weeks after the hearing, I'm still unprepared for the sheriff who now stands outside our door. “I’m here to serve you a restraining order,” she informs me. I inspect the papers. Indeed, the man has immediately turned around and sought a restraining order against me. The sheriff sympathizes but can offer no help.
  </script>
  <script id="30" type="text/markdown">
    I’m stunned that—out of an abundance of caution which I suppose I can’t argue against—this temporary order has been rubber-stamped without more skepticism. Has _our_ restraining order accomplished nothing? Is this some tit-for-tat that will continue forever? I contact potential attorneys.
  </script>
  <script id="31" type="text/markdown">
    The court hearing two weeks before Christmas is anti-climactic. My wife and I arrive half an hour early, dressed in our best suits. An hour into the hearing, the judge calls our case—which she then summarily dismisses without prejudice since the man has failed to appear. Incredulous, we’re still discussing the matter with our attorney when the man finally arrives. We nod and silently exit the courthouse as he walks past us into the courtroom.
  </script>

  <script id="33" type="text/markdown">
    My wife and I look at each other. “Is that… _him_?”
  </script>
  <script id="80" type="text/markdown">
    It’s June, and we’ve enjoyed six months of tenuous silence since the last hearing. I still see him now and then, once or twice per month in and around the building. He doesn't interact with me, but each time I think I catch the flicker of a knowing grin and feel his stare lingering on me as I walk away without acknowledgement.
  </script>
  <script id="79" type="text/markdown">
    Yet the pounding continues, and with each new disturbance, a familiar pattern emerges. My nerves fray as the late-night pounding once again becomes regular.
  </script>
  <script id="35" type="text/markdown">
    By October, the disturbances are relentless and disruptive enough that we call the police. As they leave with little more than a shrug, one officer asks where I’m from.
  </script>
  <script id="36" type="text/markdown">
    “Wisconsin,” I say, failing to realize this isn’t small talk.
  </script>
  <script id="37" type="text/markdown">
    “Well, this is Oakland.”
  </script>
  <script id="38" type="text/markdown">
    I reach out to our attorney, but his answer is no better. Pursuing contempt charges will cost us many times any potential fine. Fearing additional fees, I neglect to follow up.
  </script>
  <script id="39" type="text/markdown">
    Our neighbors ask if the pounding which keeps them up at night is the same as we hear. We confirm it is and suggest they bring their concerns to the HOA. Despite having kept the HOA up to date on the matter for over a year now, this—at long last—appears to be the secret ingredient. One household complaining about a neighbor is a dispute, but two households complaining is a liability.
  </script>
  <script id="40" type="text/markdown">
    In April, many hundreds of documented disturbances later, and after property management posts the second of two notices on the man’s door, the disturbances suddenly stop. With no explanation, we sleep more easily but brace ourselves for the disturbances to return.
  </script>
  <script id="48" type="text/markdown">

  <script id="41" type="text/markdown">
    At last, we find ourselves in the present. It’s September 2025 now, and the man still lives below us; I imagine him ten feet beneath me as I write these words. But even six months after the last disturbance, I haven't escaped his world. Each time I walk across the room or slide a chair out from the table, it’s a deliberate, considered act of normalcy, always weighed against the chance of renewed conflict.
  </script>
  <script id="72" type="text/markdown">
    I want to know the reason he’s pursued us like this, but I doubt one exists. I want a clean ending to this narrative, but I have none to offer.
  </script>
  <script id="81" type="text/markdown">
    I want to imagine this ordeal has refined my instincts, stripped away what was unproductive, left me sharper and stronger and better prepared to face such matters, but I’m not sure.
  </script>
  <script id="64" type="text/markdown">
    I helped a man with a walker up a set of stairs yesterday—he was late to a meeting and couldn’t spare the long detour to the ramp. Outwardly, it was ordinary kindness. But inwardly, and with bitterness, I offered the act to our neighbor. For every ounce of conflict he’s given me, I mete out only small tokens of goodness. There’s nothing spiteful about it, but it feels the same.
  </script>
  <script id="60" type="text/markdown">
    Maybe the disturbances will resume, maybe they won’t. I wish our neighbor only the peace he seeks.
